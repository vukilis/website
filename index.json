Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network. Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] ... Success!

Run the following commands in JBoss CLI to remove existing TLS and HTTP configuration: /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/http-listener=default:remove() /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=http:remove() /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=https:remove() /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=https:remove() :reload Wait for the reload to complete by checking the server log or the result of: :read-attribute(name=server-state) The following section explains how to set up Undertow with 3-port separation. Port 8080 is used for HTTP (unencrypted traffic), port 8442 for HTTPS (encrypted) traffic with only server authentication and port 8443 for HTTPS (encrypted) traffic with both server and client authentication. To add new interfaces and sockets, use the following: /interface=http:add(inet-address=\"0.0.0.0\") /interface=httpspub:add(inet-address=\"0.0.0.0\") /interface=httpspriv:add(inet-address=\"0.0.0.0\") /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=http:add(port=\"8080\",interface=\"http\") /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=httpspub:add(port=\"8442\",interface=\"httpspub\") /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=httpspriv:add(port=\"8443\",interface=\"httpspriv\") Configure TLS /subsystem=elytron/credential-store=defaultCS:add-alias(alias=httpsKeystorePassword, secret-value=\"serverpwd\") /subsystem=elytron/credential-store=defaultCS:add-alias(alias=httpsTruststorePassword, secret-value=\"changeit\") /subsystem=elytron/key-store=httpsKS:add(path=\"keystore/keystore.p12\",relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,credential-reference={store=defaultCS, alias=httpsKeystorePassword},type=PKCS12) /subsystem=elytron/key-store=httpsTS:add(path=\"keystore/truststore.p12\",relative-to=jboss.server.config.dir,credential-reference={store=defaultCS, alias=httpsTruststorePassword},type=PKCS12) /subsystem=elytron/key-manager=httpsKM:add(key-store=httpsKS,algorithm=\"SunX509\",credential-reference={store=defaultCS, alias=httpsKeystorePassword}) /subsystem=elytron/trust-manager=httpsTM:add(key-store=httpsTS) /subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=httpspub:add(key-manager=httpsKM,protocols=[\"TLSv1.3\",\"TLSv1.2\"],use-cipher-suites-order=false,cipher-suite-filter=\"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\",cipher-suite-names=\"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\") /subsystem=elytron/server-ssl-context=httpspriv:add(key-manager=httpsKM,protocols=[\"TLSv1.3\",\"TLSv1.2\"],use-cipher-suites-order=false,cipher-suite-filter=\"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\",cipher-suite-names=\"TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256\",trust-manager=httpsTM,need-client-auth=true) Add HTTP(S) Listeners /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/http-listener=http:add(socket-binding=\"http\", redirect-socket=\"httpspriv\") /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=httpspub:add(socket-binding=\"httpspub\", ssl-context=\"httpspub\", max-parameters=2048) /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/https-listener=httpspriv:add(socket-binding=\"httpspriv\", ssl-context=\"httpspriv\", max-parameters=2048) :reload HTTP Protocol Behaivor Configuration /system-property=org.apache.catalina.connector.URI_ENCODING:add(value=\"UTF-8\") /system-property=org.apache.catalina.connector.USE_BODY_ENCODING_FOR_QUERY_STRING:add(value=true) /system-property=org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH:add(value=true) /system-property=org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT:add(value=2048) /system-property=org.apache.cata","date":"2024-05-03","objectID":"/How-to-install-and-setup-EJBCA-with-galera-and-HSM-module/:4:16","tags":["debian","crtificates","security"],"title":"How to install and setup EJBCA 8.2 with galera and HSM module","uri":"/How-to-install-and-setup-EJBCA-with-galera-and-HSM-module/"},{"categories":["Linux"],"content":"Install Apache Ant cd /opt/packages/ wget https://dlcdn.apache.org//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.10.14-bin.zip wget https://downloads.apache.org/ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.10.14-bin.zip.sha512 unzip /opt/packages/apache-ant-1.10.14-bin.zip -d /opt/ sudo ln -s /opt/apache-ant-1.10.14 /opt/ant Note Edit /etc/profile.d/ant.sh with nano or vi. # /etc/profile.d/ant.sh export ANT_HOME=/opt/ant export PATH=${PATH}:${ANT_HOME}/bin source /etc/profile.d/ant.sh ","date":"2024-05-03","objectID":"/How-to-install-and-setup-EJBCA-with-galera-and-HSM-module/:4:17","tags":["debian","crtificates","security"],"title":"How to install and setup EJBCA 8.2 with galera and HSM module","uri":"/How-to-install-and-setup-EJBCA-with-galera-and-HSM-module/"},{"categories":["Linux"],"content":"EJBCA Installation Extract archive to /opt and create symbolic link unzip ejbca_ee_8_2_0_3.zip -d /opt/ ln -snf /opt/ejbca_ee* /opt/ejbca The folder /opt/ejbca contains the EJBCA source code.
